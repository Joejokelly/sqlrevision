üîç What this requires:
Use the surgical_encounters table.

Use the patients table to get county info.

Only include patients who had more than 1 surgery.

Group the result by county.

Return the top 5 counties by count of such patients.

Use surgical_encounters and patients

Count number of surgeries per patient

Rank patients within their county

Return only the top 2 per county

Use a window function (like ROW_NUMBER() or RANK())
